The source code consists of 2 files: main.cpp and the Makefile. An XCode project for OS X is supplied, but you're not required to use it.

Make sure the compiled file (in our case, 'sqlsplitter') is executable ('chmod +x sqlsplitter'), then run the following single command:

./sqlsplitter input_filename max_output_filesize (in bytes)
