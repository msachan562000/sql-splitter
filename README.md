# SQLSplitter

SQLSplitter is a simple command-line tool designed to split large SQL files into smaller chunks based on a specified maximum output file size.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and use SQLSplitter, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- C++ compiler
- Make utility

### Compilation

To compile SQLSplitter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to compile the source code:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

### Usage

After compilation, SQLSplitter can be used with the following command:

```bash
./sqlsplitter input_filename max_output_filesize
```

- `input_filename`: Path to the input SQL file.
- `max_output_filesize`: Maximum size limit (in bytes) for each output file.

### Example

```bash
./sqlsplitter large_database.sql 1000000000
```

This command will split the `large_database.sql` file into smaller chunks, each containing a maximum of 1GB of data.

### Executable Permissions

```bash
chmod +x sqlsplitter
```
